Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.
If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.
